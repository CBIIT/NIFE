    <h4>Welcome to the NCI Imaging Facilities Environment!</h4>
    <p>NIFE is an NCI-wide microscopy image management resource jointly developed and maintained by the NCI Imaging Facilities it supports and CBIIT.  From this page, you can submit metadata for samples to be imaged and then access the resulting images for further analysis.</p>
    <p style="color:#008">Use the Links on the left side bar to learn more about working with each of the Imaging Facilities and upload metadata</p>
    <p>OMERO image management software is at the heart of NIFE. From NIFEâ€™s OMERO web server, users can access all images associated with their research produced by the participating facilities, without the need to download. Via the web interface, users can annotate images, consult with Imaging Facility experts and collaborators, view analysis results, and initiate their own analysis workflows on linked computational resources such as Biowulf or FRCE.</p>
